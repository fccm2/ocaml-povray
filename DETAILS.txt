I tryed to make a small tutorial for this interface, with
the file:
 - tutorial/pov-tut.html

The (un-finished) Shapes module in the directory "utils/"
tries to provide some geometric shapes, like:
 - octahedron, tetrahedron, pyramids, and icosahedron

Files from the tests/ directory try to check that functions
from src/ are working correctly.

Files from test2/ are trying to check that the Shapes module
works correctly.
